The Prepared Monkfish Liver was distributed in FL, GA, MD, NJ, and NY mainly through restaurants and some retail stores. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this issue. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the product containing milk was distributed in packaging that did not declare the presence of milk. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by failing to include milk derived from an ingredient on the product label. The last distribution of the product in the marketplace was on December 14, 2024. Consumers who have purchased the product are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company atla. foodsafetygrp@mutual.usor 213-626-9458.",

        "company_announcement": "Nogales, AZ (Nov. 29, 2024) – Baloian Farms of Arizona Co., Inc. (Baloian) is recalling all sizes of whole fresh American cucumbers packaged in bulk cardboard containers labeled with the “Pamela” brand, a generic white box with a sticker that provides the implicated grower’s name, “Agrotato, S.A. de C.V.,” or a clear PamPak branded bag of 6 individual cucumbers with the UPC 8 2540107010 6 (photos below). The recalled cucumbers were sold between October 12, 2024, through November 26, 2024, and are being recalled because they have the potential to be contaminated withSalmonella. Salmonellais an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected withSalmonellaoften experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection withSalmonellacan result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Symptoms ofsalmonellosisusually start 6 hours to 6 days after infection and last 4 to 7 days. The whole fresh American cucumbers were sold by Baloian and other importers and shipped to customers located in the states of California, Arizona, Texas, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Colorado, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Alaska and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The cucumbers would have reached consumers through foodservice and retail outlets that may be located in states other than those listed above. Baloian initiated this recall after learning from SunFed Produce, LLC, that its supplier of American cucumbers, “Agrotato, S.A. de C.V.,” may be associated with reported salmonellosis illnesses between October 12 – and November 15, 2024. Discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) confirmed this. Baloian is also contacting its direct buyers to advise them of the recall and ask that they, in turn, notify their customers. No other products sold by or farms supplying to Baloian are implicated in this recall. Consumers should take the following actions: Consumers who have purchased the recalled products may obtain additional information by contacting Baloian’s customer service desk 888-840-6642, M-F 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EST. “We at Baloian Farms are working in conjunction with our grower with the FDA to protect our customers and consumers. Food Safety has always been a top priority as we want to provide safe and nutritious food for our families and consumers.” said Luis Corella, President of Baloian Farms of Arizona Co., Inc. “We have been working diligently with the authorities and the implicated farm to determine the possible source.” RETAIL DISTRIBUTION FOR “PAMELA” BRAND WHOLE FRESH AMERICAN CUCUMBERS FDA has reason to believe that the following retail locations received the whole fresh American cucumbers that were included in the recall by Baloian Farms of Arizona Co., Inc. The cucumbers may have been sold in bulk containers in retail stores. This list may not include all retail establishments that have received the recalled product or may include retail establishments that did not actually receive the recalled product. Therefore, it is important that you use the product-specific identification information, in addition to this list of retail stores, when you check the cucumbers you have purchased to determine if they have been recalled.

Healthy persons infected withSalmonellaoften experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection withSalmonellacan result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. These units of the Kirkland Signature Organic Pasture Raised 24-Count Eggs were distributed into 25 Costco stores in the States of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee beginning November 22, 2024. The Organic Pasture Raised 24-Count Eggs with UPC 9661910680 are packaged in plastic egg cartons labeled with Kirkland Signature on the top. The recall only applies to units with the Julian code 327 and a Use By Date of Jan 5, 2025, which can be found printed on the side of the plastic egg carton.

Additional supply chain controls and retraining are being put in place to prevent recurrence. To date there are no illness complaints. This recall is being done in cooperation with the FDA. Impacted consumers should stop consuming the product and should return the identified units to their local Costco store for a full refund or should dispose of the products.

        "company_announcement": "Atwater’s of Baltimore, MD, is recalling its clam shell packages of spider web tarts sold 10/19/24 and 10/20/24 because they contain undeclared almond flour. People who have allergies to tree nuts run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recalled spider web tarts were distributed on 10/19/24 and 10/20/24 at the following farmers markets located in the MD/DC/VA area: Arlington Courthouse, Falls Church, H Street, Mount Pleasant, Silver Spring, Dupont Circle, Greenbelt, and Westover. The product was in a clear clam shell plastic package marked with a green Atwater’s “Spider Web Tart” label on top and a Julian date of 292 labeled on the bottom. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem and none were sold in retail stores. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the almond containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of almonds, see below for photos of both the product and packaging in question. Subsequent investigation indicated the problem was caused by a temporary breakdown in the company’s production and labeling processes. Consumers who purchased spider web tarts on 10/19/24 and 10/20/24 at any of the listed farmers markets are urged to call or email Atwater’s directly to return the product and initiate a refund. Consumers may call Atwater’s Mon-Fri from 8:00 am – 5:00 pm EST at 410-644- 3435 or email us atinfo@atwatersfood.com.",

The product contains the undeclared allergen of sesame on an outer package. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to sesame run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume those products. The product was distributed in CA, AZ, TX, NM, WA, NY, NV through retail stores and resturants. The product is packaged in a 3.52 oz, illustrated plastic bag, containing 5 inner packages. Each inner packages has the correct allergen information. The correct UPC for the product is 074410516031, located on the back right side of the outer package. However, the outer package has an incorrect allergen declaration due to the unintentional use of incorrect packing material, which also displays the wrong UPC: 074410495534. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this issue. The recall was initiated after discovering that the product contained an undeclared allergen (sesame). Further investigation revealed that the issue was caused by the unintentional use of incorrect packaging material for the product. The last distribution of the product in the marketplace was on October 8, 2024. Consumers who have purchased the product are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.
