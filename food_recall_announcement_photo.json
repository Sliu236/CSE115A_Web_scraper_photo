Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely with acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. Product was distributed mostly through California retail stores and a few stores across the US. Product was NOT sold online. The recalled product is packaged in a 4oz plastic bag, and labeled as Super Dried Cinnamon Powder 4oz with UPC#610232012476. Specifically, products showing Vitamin A & C on the nutrition facts label. No illnesses have been reported as of 11/18/2024. This recall is being initiated as a result of routine sampling by the Arkansas Department of Health which revealed that the finished products contained elevated levels of lead. The company has ceased the distribution of the product as they continue their investigation as to what caused the problem. This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Consumers who have purchased Super Cinnamon Powder 4oz are urged to discard in the trash or return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Further investigation indicates that the issue could be caused by a potentially adulterated raw material from the supplier. While lead can affect almost all body systems, its effects depend on the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. Lead can cause serious health problems if too much is ingested, such as damage to the brain and kidneys and can interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body. The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) collected samples in February 2024 from Lot: E-054, EX 0225 and D-181, EX 0624 El Chilar Ground Cinnamon, which tested high in lead.

The recalled product was shipped to H-E-B Grocery Company, LP in TX ; and CVS in the following states: TX, FL, CA, SC, VA, IN, TN, NJ, MI, PA, RI, MO. No other products or retailers are impacted by this recall. The Company is initiating this voluntary recall in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There have been no reports of adverse events to date attributed to the elevated levels of Vitamin D in the product subject to this recall, which was determined through routine testing. For the vast majority of infants, short-term consumption of the affected lot codes is unlikely to cause adverse health implications. In a small subset of physiologically vulnerable infants (e.g., impaired renal function), there is the potential that consumption of the recalled product could result in health complications. Parents and caregivers who may have purchased the product should look for the lot codes below with “use by” dates, which can be found on the bottom of the package and should contact their health care provider if they have any concerns. Perrigo has taken immediate action by notifying H-E-B Grocery Company, LP and CVS directly and asking them to examine their retail and warehouse inventory and isolate the product.

For more information onE. coli0121:H19 and to read the initial recall notice, please visit Grimmway’swebsite. “As a part of our ongoing review of internal processes associated with the voluntary recall, we determined that four bag sizes needed to be added to our initial recall announcement,” said Jeff Huckaby, President & CEO of Grimmway Farms. “We then began the process to notify the FDA and update the consumer. The health of our consumers and the integrity of our products are our highest priorities, and we will not rest until this issue is fully resolved.” Retailers who received the affected product were appropriately notified ofallcorrect bag sizes when the company initiated the recall on November 16. The recalled carrots should not be available for purchase in stores but may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. The table below shows the additional bag sizes in bold and underlined font. E.coli O121:H19is a bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people, and those with a weakened immune system. Some infections can cause severe bloody diarrhea conditions, such as a hemolytic uremic syndrome, or the development of high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and neurologic problems. Symptoms include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and/or vomiting. The incubation period forE. coli O121:H19in humans can range from 24 hours to as much as ten days. The average incubation period is 3 to 4 days. Consumers: The recalled carrots should no longer be available for purchase but may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who purchased carrots specified in theoriginal recall notice(and in the table above) who still have them in their refrigerator or freezer should not consume them; the carrots should be destroyed or discarded so they cannot be consumed. If you have these products in your home, do not eat or use them, throw them away, and clean and sanitize surfaces they touched. Consumers concerned about an illness should contact a medical professional. “We would also like to apologize to consumers who have been unable to reach our company due to technical issues and high call volume,” stated Huckaby. “We have been working around the clock with our third-party vendors to address these challenges and have made a direct telephone number available to consumers (1-866- 912-9552).” Consumers with questions or products in their possession may contact our customer services desk at 1-866-912- 9552, Sun-Sat, 8 am – 8 pm ET or visitwww.grimmway.com.

People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to eggs run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The following products are subject to recall: The products were produced on Sept. 17 and 30, 2024, and distributed to local retail establishments and directly to customers in Wisconsin. The issue with the first lot was discovered on the evening of Nov. 4, 2024, when a customer reported the mislabeling. The second lot was added to the recall notice after discovery on Nov. 18, 2024. There have been no reports of illness associated with consumption of these products. During production, a limited number of Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream containers were inadvertently filled with Orange Custard Chocolate Chip ice cream, leading to products with incorrect allergen labeling. If you purchased one of the affected products, please check the production date located on the bottom of the container for 09 1724 (Sept. 17, 2024) or 09 3024 (Sept. 30, 2024). If your product is from the affected lot, please return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. The impacted products were distributed to the following Madison, Wisconsin, area retailers: Babcock Dairy Store, Metcalfe’s Markets, Ken’s Meats & Deli and Capitol Centre Market. Babcock Dairy Staff retrieved all the remaining products from retail outlets within hours of discovery in each incident. Out of an abundance of caution, staff searched all other lots of Orange Custard Chocolate Chip, which had not been distributed, and found no further errors. To prevent this issue from occurring again, Babcock Dairy is taking immediate corrective steps, including the retraining of employees on proper labeling procedures, implementation of multiple verification checks during production and packaging, and increased organization and separation of packaging materials to further prevent different containers from coming into contact. Babcock Dairy is housed within UW–Madison's College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Consumers with questions about the recall may contact Heidi Zoerb (heidi.zoerb@wisc.edu).

Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely with acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long- term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. Spice Class brand Ground Cinnamon was distributed to retailers located in the New York City area between 12/01/2023 and 05/15/2024. The product was not sold online. The recalled product is SPICE CLASS BRAND Ground Cinnamon packed in 7oz and 11oz packing PET jars with expiration date: 12/2026. No illnesses have been reported to date.

The products from Church Brothers did not containSalmonellaand the recall has been rescinded. On October 18, 2024 Church Brothers Farms voluntarily recalled 1271 cases of Green Onions due to the potential to be contaminated withSalmonella. This action was based on information received from the CFIA that a single product sample had tested positive for its presence. While distribution of this product was limited to a small number of retail and foodservice customers in Canada and USA, Church Brothers acted quickly and in conjunction with both the CFIA and US FDA to ensure rapid compliance with the recall. Following the positiveSalmonellaresult, the CFIA completed the whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of theSalmonellaisolate, the results of which indicated that the sample could have been cross-contaminated with the laboratory’s positive control strain. After further internal review, the CFIA conclusively determined that cross-contamination had indeed occurred. The CFIA also confirmed that the cross-contamination was an isolated event, and no other samples were affected. Given this cross-contamination, the CFIAhasrescinded the food recalland removed the notification that was published on the Government of Canada’s Recalls and Safety Alerts website. “The safety of our products is Church Brothers’ highest priority, and we pride ourselves with having the utmost integrity when it comes to Food Safety Standards,” said Megan Chedwick, Vice President of Food Safety, Quality & Regulatory Compliance at Church Brothers Farms. “While we were pleased to hear that our product did not contain the Salmonella isolate, we will always act with an abundance of caution when it comes to the health and well-being of our consumers.” This is a correction to thepress releaseissued on October 18, 2024 with the headline of “Church Brothers Farms Recall Green Onions Due to Possible Health Risk.” Company Contact InformationChurch Brothers FarmsConsumer Hotline 877-590-0428consumerinfo@churchbrothers.com Link toOriginal Press Release",

Short-term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely to be acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. ALB Flavor brand Ground Cinnamon was distributed to retailers located in New York, Connecticut, Michigan, and Massachusetts, between 12/15/2022 and 05/13/2024. The product hasn’t been sold online. The product is branded under the ALB FLAVOR name and is packaged in a plastic bag with a net weight of 100 grams. It features a brown carton packaging with an image of cinnamon powder and two cinnamon sticks centered at the bottom. On the back, you'll find information about the product's origin, a description, a QR code for recipes, the UPC 5304000333362, the Best Before date of 30/08/2025, and the Lot number LA02.

Consumers who have purchased these items are urged not to consume these products and to dispose of them or return the items to their local store for a full refund. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely with acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. El Servidor Corp ground cinnamon was distributed to retail stores in New York starting on January 14, 2024. The product comes in a 1.5-ounce clear plastic bag. The recall was the result of a sample analysis conducted by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSAGM) that revealed the product contained elevated levels of lead. The Company has ceased the production and distribution of the product as FDA and the company continues their investigation as to what caused the problem. Consumers should discontinue use of the product immediately and are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely with acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. Shahzada brand Cinnamon Powder was distributed to retailers located in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts between 01/01/2024 and 05/24/2024. This product was not sold online. The product was packed in 7oz plastic bags of the Shahzada brand. No illnesses have been reported to date. The recall was the result of an analysis conducted by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSAGM) that revealed the product contained elevated levels of lead. The company has ceased the production and distribution of the product as the FDA and the company continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.

Listeria monocytogenescan cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in pets eating contaminated products. People can become exposed to this pathogen through multiple routes such as handling the contaminated products, contact with pets that have eaten contaminated products and/or contact with surfaces that have touched contaminated food, such as bowls, utensils, or countertops. Risk of human illness fromListeria monocytogenescontaminated pet food increases if people do not thoroughly wash their hands after handling the food or having contact with their pet, or by not thoroughly cleaning contaminated surfaces. Healthy people infected withListeria monocytogenesmay experience some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, aches, fever and diarrhea.Listeria monocytogenesinfections can spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system (including the brain), resulting in meningitis and other potentially fatal illnesses. Pregnant women are especially susceptible toListeriainfection, which can result in miscarriage. The young, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems are more vulnerable to infection. People exhibiting signs ofListeria monocytogenesinfection after having contact with recalled product(s) or a pet that has eaten recalled product(s) should contact their healthcare providers. Listeria monocytogenesillnesses in pets are rare, and infected pets may display symptoms such as mild to severe diarrhea, anorexia, fever, nervous, muscular and respiratory signs, miscarriage, depression, shock and death. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. Infected pets, even if they do not show symptoms, can act as carriers and transferL. monocytogenesthrough their feces and saliva into the home environment and to people and other pets in the household. If your pet has eaten the recalled product(s) and has symptoms of Listeria monocytogenes infection, please contact your veterinarian. The products were distributed directly to consumers in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Only products from Lot 21244 are affected, Viva Raw is notifying all customers who were shipped any Turkey or Beef & Turkey for Puppies products between May 16th and June 28th, 2024.

Products matching the specific lot number below are being recalled: The issue was discovered during a facility inspection conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The North Carolina Department of Agriculture (NCDA). The FDA tested samples of Viva Turkey for Dogs and found samples from Lot 21244 were positive forListeria monocytogenes. All products produced in Lot 21244 were slated for destruction. However, we have since learned some of the product from this lot was inadvertently released from the warehouse. If you find that you have products fromLot 21244, please contact Viva Raw at info@vivarawpets.com for a refund on any remaining product—you should then destroy the food in a way that children, pets, and wildlife cannot access.

If your product is from the affected lot, please return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Out of an abundance of caution, Babcock Dairy Staff retrieved all of the remaining product from retail outlets within three hours of discovery. To prevent this issue from occurring again, Babcock Dairy is taking immediate corrective steps, including the retraining of employees on proper labeling procedures, implementation of multiple verification checks during production and packaging, and increased organization and separation of packaging materials to further prevent different containers from coming into contact.

Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found near talc, an ingredient in many cosmetic products. Asbestos, however, is a known carcinogen and its health risks are well-documented. If talc mining sites are not carefully chosen or if proper steps are not taken to adequately purify the talc ore, it may contain asbestos. The product was sent to distributors on or after January 18, 2024, by direct delivery in the following states: AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MD, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI and sold online on Amazon (Amazon.com). Both the 4875 and 4874 Baby Powder products are packaged in plastic bottles, 24 bottles to a case for the 14 oz. and 48 to a case for the 4 oz., with lot/batch numbers located on the bottom of the bottle and on each case (see images below). There have been no illnesses or adverse events reported to date. The recall was the result of a routine sampling program by the FDA, which revealed that the finished products contained asbestos. Upon further investigation, we have identified additional lots of products that may contain asbestos due to using the same bulk talc material. The company has ceased the distribution of the product as an investigation is proceeding to determine what caused the contamination of the talc. Consumers who have purchased Dynacare Baby Powder (see products/lots below) should discontinue use immediately and return it for a full refund. Please contactDynarex Corporation at 888-396-2739 or 845-365-8200 during business hours of 8:30 AM to 5:00 PMEastern Standard Time, or via email atrecall@dynarex.comif you have any questions or need information on how to return the product or receive a full refund.

(Baloian) is recalling all sizes of whole fresh American cucumbers packaged in bulk cardboard containers labeled with the “Pamela” brand, a generic white box with a sticker that provides the implicated grower’s name, “Agrotato, S.A. de C.V.,” or a clear PamPak branded bag of 6 individual cucumbers with the UPC 8 2540107010 6 (photos below). The recalled cucumbers were sold between October 12, 2024, through November 26, 2024, and are being recalled because they have the potential to be contaminated withSalmonella. Salmonellais an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected withSalmonellaoften experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection withSalmonellacan result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Symptoms ofsalmonellosisusually start 6 hours to 6 days after infection and last 4 to 7 days. The whole fresh American cucumbers were sold by Baloian and other importers and shipped to customers located in the states of California, Arizona, Texas, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Colorado, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Alaska and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The cucumbers would have reached consumers through foodservice and retail outlets that may be located in states other than those listed above. Baloian initiated this recall after learning from SunFed Produce, LLC, that its supplier of American cucumbers, “Agrotato, S.A. de C.V.,” may be associated with reported salmonellosis illnesses between October 12 – and November 15, 2024. Discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) confirmed this. Baloian is also contacting its direct buyers to advise them of the recall and ask that they, in turn, notify their customers. No other products sold by or farms supplying to Baloian are implicated in this recall. Consumers should take the following actions: Consumers who have purchased the recalled products may obtain additional information by contacting Baloian’s customer service desk 888-840-6642, M-F 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EST. “We at Baloian Farms are working in conjunction with our grower with the FDA to protect our customers and consumers. Food Safety has always been a top priority as we want to provide safe and nutritious food for our families and consumers.” said Luis Corella, President of Baloian Farms of Arizona Co., Inc. “We have been working diligently with the authorities and the implicated farm to determine the possible source.” RETAIL DISTRIBUTION FOR “PAMELA” BRAND WHOLE FRESH AMERICAN CUCUMBERS FDA has reason to believe that the following retail locations received the whole fresh American cucumbers that were included in the recall by Baloian Farms of Arizona Co., Inc. The cucumbers may have been sold in bulk containers in retail stores. This list may not include all retail establishments that have received the recalled product or may include retail establishments that did not actually receive the recalled product. Therefore, it is important that you use the product-specific identification information, in addition to this list of retail stores, when you check the cucumbers you have purchased to determine if they have been recalled.

        "company_announcement": "A previous press release was issued 08/19/2024. This updated press release includes information on the addition of Gutierrez brand ground cinnamon to the recall. Gutierrez Distributor of Passaic, NJ is recalling El Servidor Corp and Gutierrez brand ground cinnamon because it has the potential to be contaminated with elevated levels of lead. Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely with acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. El Servidor Corp ground cinnamon was distributed to retail stores in New York starting on January 14, 2024. Gutierrez brand ground cinnamon was sold to cash and carry customers. The product comes in a 1.5-ounce clear plastic bag. The recall was the result of a sample analysis conducted by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSAGM) that revealed the product contained elevated levels of lead. The Company has ceased the production and distribution of the product as FDA and the company continues their investigation as to what caused the problem. Consumers should discontinue use of the product immediately and are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

        "company_announcement": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – July 30, 2024 - Colonna Brothers of North Bergen, NJ is voluntarily recalling its 1.5oz Marcum Ground Cinnamon & 2.25oz Supreme Tradition Ground Cinnamon because of a possible health risk due to elevated lead levels. Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Additional signs and symptoms of lead exposure are more likely with acute exposure to higher levels of lead or chronic exposure to lead. The effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/ body weight. If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems. For adults, chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. The Cinnamon was distributed nationwide through retail stores and mail order. The products come in a clear plastic jar labeled with either “Marcum Cinnamon Ground 1.5oz” or “Supreme Tradition Ground Cinnamon 2.25oz”. The following lot codes have been added to the recall list as of 7-29-24 (found on the jar above the label - below the cap): No illnesses have been confirmed to date in connection with these products. The voluntary recall was recommended by the FDA following its targeted sampling of multiple different discount cinnamon brands from multiple different retail locations. Colonna Brothers is participating in this recall voluntarily as requested by the FDA. Colonna Brothers has not violated any Federal laws, regulations, and/or guidelines regarding levels of lead in cinnamon/spice, nor any protocols requiring testing for heavy metals in cinnamon/spice. Consumers who have purchased the Supreme Tradition Ground Cinnamon or Marcum Ground Cinnamon, with the lot codes listed above, can discard it or return it to the store for a full refund. Anyone concerned they may have been exposed to lead, should contact their healthcare provider to report their symptoms. Consumers with questions may contact us at 201-864-1115 between the hours of 9-5 EST. Below are previously recalled codes that we voluntarily recalled on March 6th, 2024. These codes have already been removed from shelves at all stores. Link toOriginal Press",
